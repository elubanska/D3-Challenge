# Data Journalism and D3

![Newsroom](https://media.giphy.com/media/v2xIous7mnEYg/giphy.gif)

## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! 

I create visualisation utilizing Javascript and D3 library. The goal is to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings. 

The data set included with the analysis is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
